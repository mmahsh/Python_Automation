1. Using file handling we can do file operations

# How to open a file in python ?
1. We can open a file two ways in python 
    1. open()
    2. With open()

# OPEN
1. Using open we can open only one file at a time and we have to close a file explicitly

# WITH OPEN 
1. Using with open we can open multiple files at a time and no need to close files explicitly

# File Open Modes In Python

r    ==>     It opens a file for read only.

r+   ==>     It opens a file for read and write.

w    ==>     It allows write-level access to a file. If the file already exists, 
             then it’ll get overwritten. It’ll create a new file if the same doesn’t exist.

w+   ==>     It opens a file FOR write AND read

a    ==>     It opens the file in append mode.

a+   ==>     It opens a file FOR append AND read

rb   ==>     It opens a binary file for read
